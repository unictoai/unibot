"""The coding agents on this computer — Cursor, Codex, Claude Code — seen and steered from
any device of the account.

``agents`` reads what the tools leave on disk (their session transcripts) and finds their
command-line entry points; ``runner`` sends a message into a session through those entry
points and streams what comes back; ``service`` ties both to the runtime (the bus, the hub)
so the phone or another computer can list sessions, read one, send a message and stop a run.
