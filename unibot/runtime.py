"""Where this unibot runs: on a computer, in a container, or on the phone itself.

On the phone the Android app (``android/``) starts ``unibot serve`` inside its own Linux
root file system — Alpine, unpacked from the APK, run under PRoot without root — and tells
it so through the environment:

``UNIBOT_DEVICE``
    ``android``: this process is on the phone. Nothing else changes in the agent; the
    sandbox reports the root file system as the box (there is no bubblewrap inside PRoot),
    the CLI bridge is on (``unibot-device`` and friends work from a shell command), and
    the About page says which phone.
``UNIBOT_DEVICE_MODEL``, ``UNIBOT_DEVICE_SDK``
    ``Pixel 8``, ``34`` — for the app and for the model's context.
``UNIBOT_HOST_URL``, ``UNIBOT_HOST_TOKEN``
    The app's own local API on ``127.0.0.1`` (its device capabilities as an MCP server, the
    browser view): the server connects to it as the MCP server named ``device``. The token
    is a credential and, like every ``UNIBOT_*`` variable, never reaches a shell command.

None of these are set on a computer, and everything here answers "no" then.
