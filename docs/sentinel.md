# Sentinel

Meta describes Muse's safety model as a separate *Sentinel* agent that sits between the model and its tools, approves sensitive actions, keeps credentials out of the model's reach and records what happened. unibot implements the same split. The agent never executes a tool itself; it hands the call to `Sentinel.guard()`:

```
agent ──► Sentinel.guard() ──► policy ──► approval (if needed) ──► vault.resolve ──► execute
agent ◄── redact(result)   ◄── taint bookkeeping ◄─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Code: `unibot/sentinel/gate.py` (the gate), `policy.py` (decisions), `audit.py` (log). The vault is `unibot/vault/`.

## Risk levels

Every tool declares a static `risk`:

| Level | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `safe` | reversible, local | `files` (inside the workspace), `web_search`, `remember`, `goals`, `contacts`, `skills` (list, use), `phone_screen` |
| `moderate` | reaches outside or changes state | `web_fetch`, `python_execute`, `read_emails`, `browser`, `forget`, `phone_act` |
| `sensitive` | hard to undo or externally visible | `shell`, `send_email`, `skills` (save, remove — a skill is standing instructions the model will follow later, so writing one always asks) |

A tool can raise the level for a particular call in `assess()`: `shell` attaches a warning on patterns such as `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`; `python_execute` is `moderate` for plain computation and files in the workspace but `sensitive` — with the reason on the card — when the code reaches the network, starts other programs, reads environment variables, deletes files or touches paths outside the workspace; `web_fetch` refuses private and loopback addresses outright, on every redirect hop; `phone_act` is `sensitive` with a warning when the `label` of a tap — the operator's words for what is under the finger — contains 确认支付, 转账, 提交订单, 发送, 删除 or another of `[gui] sensitive_words`, or when a step types and submits at once; a tap with no label carries a warning of its own ([gui.md](gui.md)). Tools also declare `reads_private_data` (taints the session) and `egress` with an optional `egress_target` (the host a call sends data to; unknown for `shell` and `python_execute`; the app's id for the phone), used by taint tracking.

Subprocesses started by `shell` and `python_execute` get a scrubbed environment: variables whose names look like credentials (`*KEY*`, `*TOKEN*`, `*SECRET*`, `*PASSW*`, `*CREDENTIAL*`, `*AUTH*`, `*COOKIE*`, `*SESSION*`), everything under `UNIBOT_`, `AWS_`, `AZURE_`, `GOOGLE_`, `GH_`, `GITHUB_`, `NPM_`, plus `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, are removed before the child starts, so code the model wrote cannot read the model's own API key or the vault key out of `os.environ`. A command that needs a secret gets it as a `{{vault:NAME}}` argument instead.

## The sandbox

Meta Muse gives each user's agent a VM of its own. unibot runs on your machine, so it does the next best thing on Linux: every `shell` and `python_execute` call runs in its own namespace, made with [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (the tool behind Flatpak; unprivileged, `apt install bubblewrap` / `dnf install bubblewrap`). Inside the box:

- the workspace (and `agent.extra_roots`) are the only writable places — `/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt`, `/var` are read-only, `/tmp` is private to the call, `/proc` and `/dev` are fresh;
- your home directory does not exist, and with it the vault, the data directory, ssh keys, cloud credentials and browser profiles. The only exceptions are the directory the running Python lives in (a venv or a `uv`-managed interpreter is often under home), read-only, so `python_execute` runs with the same interpreter and packages as unibot; the skill folders (built-in and yours), read-only, so a skill's scripts and reference files can be run and read from inside; and what you share on purpose — `[sandbox] share_read_only` for programs (`~/.nvm` with node and the Feishu CLI in it), `share` for the state a tool must also write (its login, `~/.lark-cli` and `~/.local/share/lark-cli`). Shared directories under your home are also visible at the same place under the box's own home, so a tool that looks in `$HOME` finds them; the rest of home stays out. A data directory that sits inside the workspace is masked;
- there is **no network** unless the call was assessed as needing it: a `shell` command that runs a network program (`curl`, `wget`, `pip`, `git`, `ssh`, `npm`, `docker` …) or contains a URL or hostname, or says `network=true`; a `python_execute` script that imports a network module (`requests`, `httpx`, `socket`, `urllib` …) or starts other programs. Everything else runs with only the loopback interface. A command that fails for want of the network gets a note in its result saying so, and the model can run it again with `network=true` — which is then an egress call and goes through the same review as any other;
- the process tree, IPC, UTS and cgroup namespaces are separate; `HOME` and `TMPDIR` point into the private `/tmp`; `UNIBOT_SANDBOX=bwrap` is set so a script can tell.

This changes what *egress* means for `shell`: without a sandbox every shell command is treated as one that may reach the network (and after private data has been read, asks); with one, only commands that have the network are. A boxed `ls` after reading mail cannot send anything anywhere, so it does not ask on that ground — it is still `sensitive` and still asks in `ask` mode, as every shell command does.

`[sandbox] mode` is `auto` (the default: use bubblewrap when it is installed and can create a namespace here), `bwrap` (insist — `unibot doctor` fails and the log says why when it cannot) or `off`. Where it does not work — macOS, Windows, most Docker containers (the default seccomp profile blocks unprivileged user namespaces, which is fine: the container is the box) — commands run as before, with the scrubbed environment and the workspace as working directory, and *Settings → Safety* says so. `unibot doctor` prints the sandbox line; the settings API has it under `sandbox`.

**Ubuntu 24.04 and its derivatives** restrict unprivileged user namespaces with AppArmor: `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` leaves a namespace made by a program with no AppArmor profile of its own without capabilities. Depending on the machine, bubblewrap then fails outright (`bwrap: setting up uid map: Permission denied`) or makes the box but cannot set up its network namespace (`bwrap: loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted`). In the second case unibot keeps the box for the file system and gives up on the network: the status line says *the network is not blocked*, and `shell` commands are judged as they are without a box — every one may reach out. In both cases the fix is the stock profile for `/usr/bin/bwrap`, which Ubuntu 25.04 ships in `apparmor` and 24.04 has in `apparmor-profiles` (it was pulled from the default set after a Flatpak regression):

```bash
sudo apt install apparmor-profiles
sudo install -m 0644 /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bwrap-userns-restrict /etc/apparmor.d/
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
```

`unibot doctor` says when this is the situation. Turning the restriction off (`sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`) also works but weakens the whole machine, not just the box.

## Decision order

For each call, the first matching step decides:

1. **`deny_tools`** → deny.
2. **`[[sentinel.rules]]`**: `tool` (glob, `*` for any) plus `match`, a map of argument name → glob pattern matched against `str(value)`. The first rule that matches wins and yields its `action`.
3. **`always_allow_tools` / `always_ask_tools`**.
4. **Taint**: the session is tainted **and** the call has egress to a host not in `egress_allowlist` (or to an unknown destination) → ask. The approval card shows the destination when it is known.
5. **Risk × mode**:

| mode | `safe` | `moderate` | `sensitive` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ask` (default) | allow | allow | ask |
| `strict` | allow | ask | ask |
| `auto` | allow | allow | allow |

6. **Warnings**: a call that carries a warning (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`, code that reads the environment or deletes files) is never waved through by the mode or by `always_allow_tools`; it asks. Only an explicit `allow` rule can override this.

`auto` still honours `deny_tools`, deny rules and step 6. It is what `unibot daemon`, `--auto` and the app's "Hands-off" setting use — and background goal passes, which is why a dangerous command in an unattended run turns into a card in the Feed instead of just running.

## Approvals

When the decision is *ask*, the UI (console, or an approval card in the app) shows the tool, the summarised call, what you asked for that led to it (the *purpose*), the exact arguments, the risk level and the reasons. You can deny, or allow with a scope:

| Answer | Effect |
|---|---|
| Deny | the tool is not run; the model gets a "Sentinel blocked" result and is told not to retry the same call |
| Once | this call only; nothing is remembered |
| For this task | until the agent finishes what it is doing now (the current run); for `shell` this covers the tool, not just the programs in the current command |
| Until restart | until the process exits |
| For 24 hours | persisted in `<data_dir>/approvals.json` with an expiry |
| Always | persisted until you revoke it |

An approval is a capability, not a mood. It is bound to a **grant key**: the tool plus what the call touches — `web_fetch:example.com`, `send_email:alice@example.com`, `shell:git`, `browser:booking.com`. Allowing `git` commands for the session says nothing about `curl`; a pipeline such as `git status | head` needs every program covered (approving it grants each program separately), and an email to two people needs both recipients. The one deliberate exception is *for this task* on `shell`: a job that needs `git` now will need `ls` and `wc` a moment later, so that answer covers the shell for the rest of the run — while destinations (recipients, hosts) stay bound even within a task. Tools without a meaningful target (`python_execute`, an MCP tool) are granted as a whole, and the Sentinel only offers *once* and *for this task* for arbitrary code with network access. A call that carries a warning (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`) is approved one at a time — standing permissions never cover it.

Everything you granted is listed under the avatar in the app (Permissions), each with its own revoke button; `DELETE /api/approvals/grants/{key}` and `DELETE /api/approvals` do the same from the API, and `unibot chat`'s `/forget-approvals` clears them in the console.

In the app an unanswered card times out after `server.approval_timeout` seconds (default one hour) and counts as deny. The agent keeps accepting new messages while a card is waiting. Cards that were still pending when the server stopped are marked expired on restart; the run behind them is gone.

## Taint tracking

Reading private data (`read_emails`, `recall`, `contacts`, files outside the workspace, MCP servers marked `reads_private_data`) marks the session as tainted. From then on, any call that sends data to a host outside `egress_allowlist` needs approval, whatever its risk level. This is the practical defence against prompt injection: a web page cannot instruct the agent to post your inbox somewhere without you seeing the destination first.

`unibot chat` shows the state with `/tainted`; `/reset` clears it with the conversation. The default allowlist covers search, Wikipedia, GitHub and PyPI; edit `egress_allowlist` to fit your own connectors. A destination you set yourself in the settings — the search provider under `[connectors.search]`, whichever it is — counts like the allowlist: the model cannot redirect it, so a search after private data was read goes through as it does with DuckDuckGo.

## Credential vault

```bash
unibot vault set EMAIL_PASSWORD        # prompted; stored Fernet-encrypted in <data_dir>/vault.enc
unibot vault list                      # names only
unibot vault delete EMAIL_PASSWORD
```

Config values and tool arguments can reference secrets as `{{vault:NAME}}`. The placeholder is what the model sees in prompts, tool schemas and its own arguments. Sentinel substitutes the real value immediately before execution, and if a secret shows up in a tool's output it is replaced with `{{vault:NAME}}` before the model reads it. The key is `<data_dir>/vault.key` (created on first use, mode 600) or `UNIBOT_VAULT_KEY`.

## Audit log

Every user message, model turn, decision, approval, tool call and result is appended to `<data_dir>/audit.jsonl` with a UTC timestamp:

```bash
unibot audit -n 50          # table
unibot audit --json         # raw lines
```

The app's activity sheet (tap the avatar) reads the same file.

## What this does and does not protect against

Meta Muse runs each user's agent in its own cloud VM with the Sentinel outside it. unibot runs on your machine, as your user, and its Sentinel is a module in the same process. That changes what the safeguards can promise. Honest summary:

**Covered**

- *The model acting beyond what you asked.* Every tool call goes through the policy; sensitive and dangerous calls stop for a decision; permissions are scoped to a tool and a target and can be revoked.
- *Prompt injection that tries to exfiltrate.* Once private data has been read, egress to any host not on the allowlist asks first, with the destination on the card. `web_fetch` cannot be pointed at loopback, link-local, private or cloud-metadata addresses, including through redirects.
- *The model seeing your secrets.* Keys and passwords live in the encrypted vault and enter tool calls as placeholders; they are substituted after approval and redacted from results. Subprocesses do not inherit credential-looking environment variables, and in the sandbox cannot read the vault, the data directory or anything else under your home. The model never sees the access token of the app.
- *Not knowing what happened.* Everything is in `audit.jsonl` and the Activity view.

**Not covered — know this before you run it**

- *OS-level isolation, where the sandbox does not run.* On Linux with bubblewrap a boxed command sees only the workspace, cannot reach your home directory and has no network unless the call says so (see [The sandbox](#the-sandbox)); a bubblewrap namespace is not a VM, and a kernel vulnerability or a `network=true` call you approve is still what it is. Everywhere else `shell` and `python_execute` run as you: a command you approve can do anything you can, and the pattern checks are a tripwire an adversarial script can evade. Run unibot in a container or a dedicated user account there if the workspace touches anything you would miss (the Docker image is one such setup).
- *The vault key on disk.* By default the Fernet key sits next to the vault (`vault.key`, mode 600). Anyone who can read your data directory can decrypt the vault. Set `UNIBOT_VAULT_KEY` from a secret manager if that matters to you.
- *DNS rebinding.* `web_fetch` checks the resolved address before the request; a hostile DNS server answering differently a moment later can still point the request at an internal address. The taint rule and the allowlist limit what such a fetch could be combined with.
- *Bad grants.* "Always allow `shell:curl`" is exactly as strong as it sounds. Warnings still ask, but the destination of a `curl` is not inspected.
- *The network the app is on.* The API is protected by a bearer token over plain HTTP by default. Do not expose the port to the internet; use Tailscale or a TLS reverse proxy. Secrets typed into the Connections screen travel over that connection.
- *What the model providers see.* Every memory goes to the chat model in the system prompt — that is what memory is for. A picture attached in chat goes to the chat model as image content when it takes images (`llm.vision`); a document does not go anywhere until the agent reads it with `files`, and then its text goes the way every tool result does. With recall by meaning, the text of every memory also goes to the embedding endpoint, once each, and each message once. When that is the model's own endpoint nothing new is shared; when it is another service (`memory.embedding_base_url`), that service sees your memories and messages too — a local Ollama is the choice that shares them with nobody. Embedding calls are not tool calls, so they are outside the taint rule; they never carry vault values.
- *Approval fatigue.* If cards are approved without reading them, none of this helps.

Report anything that contradicts the "covered" list — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Writing a safe tool

- Set an honest `risk`; when in doubt, `moderate`.
- Set `reads_private_data = True` if the output can contain the user's private data, and `egress = True` (with `egress_target` from `assess()` when the host is known) if the call sends data anywhere.
- Override `assess()` to raise the level for dangerous argument patterns and to produce a short human-readable `summary`; it is what the approval card shows.
- Never read secrets yourself. Accept `{{vault:NAME}}` placeholders and let Sentinel resolve them.
- Return errors as `ToolResult(error=...)` rather than raising; `safe_execute` catches the rest.
