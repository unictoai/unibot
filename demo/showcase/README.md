# The public showcase

A page anyone can open: a phone in the browser with 微信, 支付宝, 铁路12306 and the other
[MobileGym](https://github.com/Purewhiter/mobilegym) apps on it, and unibot installed. Open
unibot, and a **private unibot is started for you** on the showcase server — your own
container, your own token, phone operation on — for thirty minutes and within a model budget.
Ask it to check the earliest train to Shanghai and watch it open 12306 on the phone.

Nothing about the phone runs on the server. MobileGym is a React app: the whole simulated
phone lives in the visitor's tab (~400 MB of *their* memory). The server runs three things:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Caddy** | HTTPS, the static site (MobileGym + the unibot app), `/api/demo/*` to the gateway, and one hostname per session |
| **gateway** (`gateway/`) | Starts a unibot container per visitor, relays the phone's HTTP and WebSocket to it, proxies the container's model calls to the provider with the demo key, keeps the books |
| **sessions** | `ghcr.io/unictoai/unibot` containers on an internal Docker network with no way out — the gateway is the only thing they can reach |

```
visitor's browser ──HTTPS──▶ Caddy ── demo.unibot.dev ──▶ /srv/site (MobileGym + unibot app)
   │  MobileGym phone            │                      └▶ /api/demo/* ──▶ gateway
   │  unibot app (iframe)      └── <id>.s.unibot.dev ─────────────────▶ gateway ──▶ nm-<id>:8787
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘        │
                                            models ◀── gateway ◀── /llm/<id>/{main,gui} ◀──┘
```

A session is one hostname (`<id>.s.unibot.dev`) because the unibot web app and the
MobileGym module both take a server *origin*, and because the browser then keeps each session's
token in its own `localStorage`. The wildcard certificate that needs is why Caddy is built with
the Cloudflare DNS module.

## What the gateway enforces

- **One container per visitor**, `--read-only`, no capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, 512 MB,
  one CPU, 256 processes, tmpfs for `/data` and `/workspace`. Gone after `SESSION_TTL_S`
  (30 min) or `IDLE_TTL_S` (10 min) without traffic, and everything in it with it.
- **No network** from the containers except to the gateway (`docker network --internal`). The
  web fetch and shell tools cannot reach the internet from a demo session; the phone can.
- **The demo key never leaves the server.** Containers get a per-session key and
  `UNIBOT_LLM_BASE_URL=http://gateway:8000/llm/<id>/main`; the gateway swaps the key and
  forwards to the provider. Streaming passes through; `usage` (asked for on streams) is what
  the budget counts.
- **Budgets:** per session `SESSION_LLM_REQUESTS` / `SESSION_LLM_TOKENS`, per day (Asia/Shanghai)
  `DAILY_LLM_REQUESTS` / `DAILY_LLM_TOKENS`. Over budget, the model call gets an OpenAI-shaped
  429 and the agent tells the visitor.
- **Per visitor (IP):** `PER_IP_ACTIVE` sessions at once, `PER_IP_DAILY` a day. `MAX_SESSIONS`
  overall.
- **Bring your own key:** the visitor can enter a provider URL, model and key on the setup page.
  The gateway keeps them in memory for the session and forwards with them (no budget of ours);
  the container never sees the key. Only `https://` to hosts in `BYOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (the usual
  providers), never to an address inside the server's network.

Two lanes: `main` (the model that talks to the visitor) and `gui` (the one that reads screens
and taps; many small calls with a screenshot each). The default is 阿里云百炼's `qwen3.8-27b`
for both — it reads screenshots, so one key does everything. Set `GUI_*` to split the lanes.

### Trial credentials for the phone app

The same proxy can hand a new phone its first model. With `TRIAL_ENABLED=1`, `POST /api/trial`
with `{"device": "<a random id the app keeps>"}` answers with a key (`nmt_…`) and two
addresses — `https://<SITE_HOST>/llm/trial/<id>/main` and `…/gui` — that go straight into the
app's `[llm]` and `[gui]` settings. Every call through them is metered against the trial's
lifetime budget, `TRIAL_TOKENS` (a million); spent, the proxy answers 429 `trial_exhausted` and
the app asks for the user's own key. One trial per device: asking again with the same id
rotates the key and keeps the count, so a reinstall recovers nothing extra. New trials are
capped per address (`TRIAL_PER_IP_DAILY`) and per day (`TRIAL_DAILY_NEW`, 200); all trials
together may spend `TRIAL_DAILY_TOKENS` a day; each is held to `TRIAL_RPM` requests a minute.
Trials live in SQLite on the `gateway-data` volume and survive restarts; `GET /api/trial/<id>`
with the key shows what is left, and `/api/demo/info` carries the totals.

### unibot Web: a kept Muse per Cloud account

The showcase gives a visitor a Muse for half an hour. With `WEB_ENABLED=1` the same gateway
gives a *person* one that stays — this is the web version at
[unibot.cn/web/](https://unibot.cn/web/), for anyone who would rather not install
anything. `/web/` is a sign-in page (served by the gateway; the site's Caddy block hands
`/web/*` and `/api/web/*` over to it): an e-mail or a mobile number, then the six-digit code.
The gateway asks unibot Cloud for the code and checks it (`POST /v1/auth/code`,
`/v1/auth/verify`, the visitor's address forwarded so the relay's per-address limits still
count the right person), gets the account's key back, and starts — or wakes — the account's
container: `nmw-<slug>` with three named volumes (`/data`, `/workspace`, `/home/muse`), on the
`unibot-web` network (a way out, and the relay next to it), signed in from the environment
(`UNIBOT_CLOUD_KEY`, `UNIBOT_CLOUD_BASE_URL=http://unibot-relay:8787`,
`UNIBOT_HUB_NAME=Web`, `UNIBOT_ONBOARDED=1`; `unibot/hub/service.py`,
`_seed_from_env`). The browser is sent to `https://<slug>.<SESSION_DOMAIN>/?token=…`, the same
door the phone's QR code opens, and the runtime there makes the Cloud its model on first
start and takes its place on the hub as one of the account's devices — so the phone can ask
it for things and it can ask the phone.

What the gateway keeps is small (`WEB_DB`, SQLite on the `gateway-data` volume): account id →
slug, access token, the key the container was started with. The slug is an HMAC of the
relay's opaque account id, so signing in from another browser lands in the same Muse (with a
fresh key: the container is recreated around the same volumes). A container that has been
quiet for `WEB_IDLE_STOP_S` (six hours) is stopped, not removed; the next request on its host
starts it again, which takes a few seconds. `WEB_MAX_RUNNING` containers run at once — when
every place is taken the quietest sleeps to make room, unless it was used in the last five
minutes (`503 web_busy`) — and `WEB_MAX_ACCOUNTS` may exist at all (`503 web_full`). Model
use is the account's own allowance on the relay; the gateway meters nothing here.

## Deploying

You need: a Linux box with Docker (4 cores / 8 GB is plenty for `MAX_SESSIONS=20` — a session
idles at ~150 MB), a domain on Cloudflare, and a 百炼 key (or any OpenAI-compatible provider
that takes images).

```bash
# 1. DNS on Cloudflare:   demo.unibot.dev  A  <server>   DNS only (see the note on the proxy)
#                         *.s.unibot.dev   A  <server>   DNS only — sessions are WebSockets to Caddy
#    Cloudflare → My Profile → API Tokens: Zone → DNS → Edit and Zone → Zone → Read on the zone.

# 2. the code
git clone https://github.com/unictoai/unibot.git && cd unibot/demo/showcase
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env          # names, ACME_EMAIL, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, keys

# 3. what the sessions run
docker pull ghcr.io/unictoai/unibot:latest  # or: docker build -t unibot:latest ../.. && set UNIBOT_IMAGE

# 4. (optional, 1.9 GB) MobileGym's companion data: app media and home-screen widgets.
#    Without it the phone works but media apps render empty and two home widgets show an error.
mkdir -p data && curl -L https://github.com/Purewhiter/mobilegym/releases/download/data-v0.1.0/mobilegym-data-v0.1.0.tar.gz | tar -xz -C data
#    CC BY-NC 4.0 — non-commercial use only (see MobileGym's LICENSE-DATA).

# 5. up — the published images (.github/workflows/showcase.yml builds them from main) …
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
#    … or build them here (clones MobileGym and compiles Caddy; a few minutes):
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f gateway
```

Open `https://demo.unibot.dev`, find unibot in the launcher (search works), and it starts.
`curl https://demo.unibot.dev/api/demo/info` shows sessions in use and today's spend.

Updating: `git pull && docker pull ghcr.io/unictoai/unibot:latest && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
Sessions in flight end when the gateway restarts; visitors get *Your Muse on the showcase server
has ended* and a button for a new one.

Both certificates are obtained through Cloudflare's DNS API (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`); the
records themselves stay "DNS only". Cloudflare's proxy can be switched on for `SITE_HOST`
when the site is under attack — Caddy is built with the
[cloudflare-ip](https://github.com/WeidiDeng/caddy-cloudflare-ip) module and trusts
`X-Forwarded-For` from Cloudflare's ranges only, so `PER_IP_*` keeps counting visitors rather
than edges (set the zone's SSL/TLS mode to *Full (strict)*: the origin has a real certificate).
It is off by default on purpose: from mainland China the free plan routes through overseas
edges, and the phone's 1.6 MB bundle that a Hong Kong server delivers in 2–3 s took 15–40 s
through the proxy in our measurements. The audience this is for reaches the origin faster.

### Other sites on the same Caddy

The Caddyfile ends with `import /etc/caddy/sites.d/*.caddy`, and `docker-compose.yml` mounts
`sites.d/` there and `www/` (or `WWW_ROOT`) at `/srv/www`, both read-only and both ignored by
git. One file per site, its files under `www/<name>/`, then `docker compose up -d caddy` — a box
that has no such sites is unchanged.

The project site is served this way at [unibot.cn](https://unibot.cn): `mirror/` holds the
site block and `sync.sh`, which a systemd timer runs every minute to pull
[unictoai.github.io](https://github.com/nano-muse/nano-muse.github.io) into `www/unibot.cn/`
— a push to that repository is on the mirror within the minute, with no key or webhook anywhere.
`sudo mirror/install.sh` sets up all of it and is safe to run again after `git pull`. What is not
in the repository: two A records at the registrar (`unibot.cn`, `www.unibot.cn` → this box).
A server outside mainland China needs no ICP filing for a `.cn` name; one inside does.

The same box mirrors the releases: `mirror/release-sync.py`, run by a second timer every fifteen
minutes, asks the GitHub API for the newest two releases (drafts and pre-releases skipped) and
fetches every asset into `www/dl/<tag>/`, checking each against the SHA-256 GitHub records for it;
`www/dl/latest` points at the newest tag, `www/dl/index.json` lists what is there, older tags are
removed. The site block serves the directory at [unibot.cn/dl/](https://unibot.cn/dl/) with a
listing, and the site's download switch ("GitHub / 国内镜像") rewrites its links to
`https://unibot.cn/dl/<tag>/<file>`. About 1.3 GB per release; `MIRROR_RELEASES_KEEP` in
`/etc/default/unibot-site-mirror` changes how many are kept. `install.sh` installs this too and
starts the first fetch in the background (`journalctl -u unibot-release-mirror` to watch it).

And it counts: the site block writes a JSON access log (`logs/caddy/`, rolled, kept seven days),
and `mirror/traffic.py` — `unibot-traffic`, every ten minutes — turns what was added since the
last run into daily counts in `/var/lib/unibot-traffic/traffic.db`: page views, visitors (a
hash of address and browser under a salt made for the day and dropped two days later; no address
is ever written), crawlers, downloads per file from `/dl/`, referring sites, the pages; once a run
it also records the repository's stars and GitHub's own release download counts. The relay
(cloud/deploy/unibot-hk) mounts the database read-only and shows it on its operator page;
`unibot-traffic --report` prints the last two weeks in the terminal.

### Running it on your machine

The gateway runs anywhere Docker does; Caddy is only for TLS and names. Browsers resolve
`*.localhost` to the loopback, so:

```bash
docker network create --internal unibot-sessions
docker build -t unibot:local ../..                        # the sessions' image
site/build.sh                                              # clones MobileGym, builds with VITE_UNIBOT_DEMO=/api/demo
cd gateway && pip install -e '.[dev]' && cd ..
PUBLIC_SCHEME=http SITE_HOST=localhost SESSION_DOMAIN=s.localhost PUBLIC_PORT=:8000 \
UNIBOT_IMAGE=unibot:local SITE_DIR=$PWD/site/dist \
MAIN_API_KEY=sk-... python -m showcase_gateway              # http://localhost:8000
```

`cd gateway && pytest` runs the gateway's tests (no Docker needed; the containers are faked).

## Costs, roughly

A session that asks two or three things, one of them on the phone, is 5–15 model calls and
20–60k tokens: about ¥0.05–0.2 at DeepSeek/百炼 prices. Two hundred sessions a day is ¥20–40.
The daily caps in `.env.example` (3,000 calls / 6M tokens) bound the worst day at a few tens of
yuan; lower them if you like. Put a spending alert on the provider accounts too — the gateway's
counters live in memory and start from zero when it restarts.

## Known limits

- One gateway, one host. The session counters are in memory (the trials are in SQLite); that is
  fine for a showcase and would need a shared store to scale out.
- The gateway holds the Docker socket, i.e. root on the host. It is the trusted part; keep it
  off the public network (compose does: only Caddy is published).
- No egress from sessions means the search, fetch and browser tools fail inside a demo. That is
  the point of the demo — the phone — but say so if visitors ask.
- The MobileGym data set is CC BY-NC 4.0; the showcase is non-commercial.
