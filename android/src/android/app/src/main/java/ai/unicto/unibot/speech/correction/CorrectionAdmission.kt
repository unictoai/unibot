 * into `confusion_dictionary`, or a plain content rewrite to discard.
 *
 * Port of iOS `Agent/Speech/CorrectionAdmission.swift` (bf0234a7).
 *
 * Replaces the old single-axis rule (`phoneticSim >= 0.6 AND lengthRatio <= 2`),
 * which — because [PinyinNormalizer.normalize] passes Latin/digits through
 * literally — mis-scored the most common real edits (Chinese-English mixing,
 * acronym expansion, digit normalization) as rewrites and dropped them. Analysis
 * of 35 real correction_events on iOS: the old rule kept ~1 of the ~14 that
 * should have been collected.
 *
 * Pure value logic — no DB, no provider, no Android framework — so it unit-tests
 * standalone (the normalizer is injected, since the production one needs
 * `android.icu`, which is unavailable on the JVM).
