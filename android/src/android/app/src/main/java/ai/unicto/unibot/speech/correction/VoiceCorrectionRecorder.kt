/**
 * [T-android-voice-correction] Captures the user's own fixes as training
 * signal. Port of iOS `Agent/Speech/VoiceCorrectionRecorder.swift`.
 *
 * Two entry points share ONE admission rule, differing only in `source`:
 *  - [recordTranscriptEdit] — the user edited an ASR transcript.
 *  - [recordTextInputEdit]  — the user selected text in a plain input field and
 *    replaced it.
 *
 * ## The admission rule
 * An edit is learned only when the before/after are PHONETICALLY CLOSE
 * (similarity ≥ 0.6) and comparable in length (ratio ≤ 2.0). That is what
 * separates "the recognizer misheard me" from "I changed my mind" — and it is
 * why the plain-text path can reuse this untouched: a select-and-replace that
 * swaps in something that sounds nothing like the original is a rewrite, and
 * rewrites teach the dictionary nothing but noise.
 *
 * ## Privacy
 * Every entry point is consent-gated, and NOTHING here logs verbatim user text
 * — only lengths and scores. The database row keeps the truth; the log does
 * not need it.
 *
 * Callers must invoke these off the main thread; they do blocking SQLite work.
