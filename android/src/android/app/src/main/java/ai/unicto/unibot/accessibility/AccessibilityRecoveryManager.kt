/**
 * [T-android-a11y-force-stop-recovery] Detects a revoked accessibility grant
 * and offers to repair it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `adb shell am force-stop` — and the equivalent "force stop" button in system
 * Settings, plus the aggressive "clear" action on several OEM ROMs — makes the
 * framework REMOVE our component from `Settings.Secure`
 * .ENABLED_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES. Verified empirically on Pixel 4a / Android
 * 13: after a force-stop the key is emptied, `accessibility_enabled` drops to
 * 0, and it never self-heals — waiting does nothing and relaunching the app
 * does nothing. The user has to walk back into Settings → Accessibility.
 *
 * This is deliberate AOSP behaviour, not a Unibot defect: the same test against
 * Google's own TalkBack, Bitwarden and AutoX reproduced it identically. With
 * two services enabled and only one force-stopped, the framework surgically
 * removes just the stopped one — i.e. it is a security decision (a
 * force-stopped app must not keep the ability to read the screen).
 *
 * Note that ordinary "swipe away from recents" does NOT do this: an
 * accessibility service pins its host process at adj=100 (bound by `system`),
 * so the process survives and the grant is untouched. Only force-stop-class
 * kills matter here.
 *
 * ## Why an app normally cannot fix this
 *
 * Writing ENABLED_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES requires WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS, which
 * is not grantable to a normal app. That is why none of the apps surveyed even
 * *detect* the loss. Unibot is in a better position because it already ships a
 * Shizuku client: with Shizuku authorized we can run `settings put secure`
 * with shell privilege and repair the grant in place, which was verified to
 * take effect immediately (the service rebinds without a relaunch).
 *
 * So there are two tiers:
 *  - Shizuku READY  → one-tap repair, no trip to Settings.
 *  - otherwise      → explain the situation and deep-link to Settings.
