/**
 * [T-android-mem-probe-trust] Records large, workload-driven allocations and
 * the heap headroom around them.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The 2026-08-15 field log recorded `bodyLen=2342987` for the request that
 * preceded a process death, but nothing about what that cost: no before/after
 * heap, no headroom, no indication of whether the allocation nearly failed.
 * So "did serialising this body kill the app?" was unanswerable from the log
 * and had to be guessed at.
 *
 * This probe brackets such an allocation and records what actually happened.
 * A near-miss (heap crossing the pressure line, or a big jump in peak RSS)
 * is then visible in the very same log the user attaches to a report.
 *
 * ## Recording, not preventing
 *
 * This deliberately does not truncate or reject anything — a probe that
 * changes behaviour makes the next field report describe the probe rather
 * than the bug. It only observes, and shouts when the numbers are alarming.
