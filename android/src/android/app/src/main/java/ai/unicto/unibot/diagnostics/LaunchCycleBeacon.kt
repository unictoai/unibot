 * up by MIUI / LMK" (no clean-exit marker; previous run's last tick was
 * recent, in foreground) from "we crashed" (ACRA / native handler already
 * wrote a `.log` file) or "normal launch after explicit exit" (clean-exit
 * marker present).
 *
 * The beacon is one small JSON-ish line per launch under
 * `filesDir/logs/launch-beacon.log`. We don't roll it — entries are tiny
 * and a long history helps spot MIUI-kill patterns over days.
 *
 * Bug 2 in the v1.8-dev MIUI feedback report ("app crash" with no
 * crash-*.log file): adding this beacon means the next launch can log
 * "previous run had no clean exit and no crash report — likely LMK or
 * MIUI background cleanup", which is what we want to confirm.
