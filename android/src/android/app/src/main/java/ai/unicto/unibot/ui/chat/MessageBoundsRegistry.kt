/**
 * Per-conversation registry of currently-laid-out message bounds. Lets the
 * outer [androidx.compose.foundation.text.selection.SelectionContainer]'s
 * custom [androidx.compose.ui.platform.TextToolbar] look up which message
 * a selection rect belongs to so it can offer "Copy Markdown" / "Copy Rich
 * Text" of the originating message's full markdown.
 *
 * The registry is keyed by message id and stores the message's bounds in
 * window coordinates plus a snapshot of its joined markdown source. Each
 * `AssistantMessageView` writes into the registry via `onGloballyPositioned`
 * and clears its entry on dispose.
 *
 * Lookup picks the message whose bounds vertically contain the y-center of
 * the query rect — selection rects are typically short horizontal ranges,
 * but they cleanly belong to a single message in the y axis. When no entry
 * matches (cross-message selection or a rect that misses everything) the
 * lookup returns null and the caller falls back to the system Copy bar
 * behavior.
