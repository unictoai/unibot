/**
 * [T-android-seccomp-selfheal / GH#186] Decide when a proot child's death looks
 * like the host kernel's seccomp fast path miscompiling our syscall filter,
 * and should be retried once with `PROOT_NO_SECCOMP=1`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * GH#186: on one reporter's ARM64 device, `/bin/true` and `uname` run fine
 * inside the Alpine rootfs but `apk --version` dies instantly with SIGBUS and
 * `apk update` with SIGSEGV. We could not reproduce it: on a Pixel 6 the very
 * same bytes (rootfs binaries verified byte-identical to the shipped tarball)
 * with the very same argv run `apk update` to completion. So the fault is not
 * in what we ship — it is in how the host kernel handles proot's
 * ptrace+seccomp interaction, which is exactly the class of bug proot itself
 * documents a workaround for: `PROOT_NO_SECCOMP=1` (see
 * deps/proot/src/tracee/event.c:97 and deps/proot/src/cli/cli.c:140, and
 * upstream's "Add PR_epoll_wait SIGSYS handler" for a kernel that mis-fires the
 * same way).
 *
 * The symptom distribution is the tell: `apk` is the **only dynamically linked
 * program** in the minirootfs — `/bin/true` and `uname` are busybox symlinks.
 * That points at the dynamic-loading/mmap path under ptrace, not at file
 * content, and it means any dynamically linked guest binary can be hit, not
 * just apk. Hence this is applied at the sandbox launch layer rather than
 * special-cased for apk.
 *
 * ## Why gate on "early" rather than retrying every signal death
 *
 * A retry is only safe when the crash cannot have had side effects the user
 * would not want repeated. A guest program that runs for a while and *then*
 * segfaults may already have written files, mutated the rootfs, or sent
 * network traffic; re-running it could double those effects, and its crash is
 * far more likely to be a genuine bug in that program than a host-kernel
 * quirk. The GH#186 signature is the opposite: death is effectively immediate,
 * during dynamic linking, before `main()` can do anything observable.
 *
 * So the trigger is deliberately narrow — **fatal signal AND died early AND
 * produced no output**. Normal non-zero exits (a failing build, `grep` finding
 * nothing, a user's own buggy program) never qualify, which is the safety
 * boundary the fix requires: this must not silently re-run arbitrary user
 * commands.
