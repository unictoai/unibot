/**
 * [T-android-mem-probe-trust] Trustworthy process-memory readings.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The 2026-08-15 field log reported `nativeHeapMB=9744` — 9.7 GB — from
 * `Debug.getNativeHeapAllocatedSize()`, on a device with 6 GB of RAM and a
 * 512 MB heap ceiling. Both a 17-message session (23 KB of text) and a
 * 1528-message one produced multi-GB readings, so the number did not track
 * workload at all. That reading sent a whole investigation down the wrong
 * path: it was read as "native heap exploded → OOM kill", and a request-body
 * serialisation fix was scoped off the back of it.
 *
 * `Debug.getNativeHeapAllocatedSize()` delegates to the platform allocator and
 * some vendor ROMs (the field device was vivo — `/proc/vivo_rsc/…` appears in
 * its logcat tail) return an accumulated or address-space figure rather than
 * live bytes. A Pixel 4a under a deliberately larger workload reported 23 MB
 * from the same call, i.e. the API is not comparable across devices and must
 * not be the only number in the log.
 *
 * ## What this reports instead
 *
 * `/proc/self/status` is the kernel's own accounting and is consistent across
 * vendors: [rssKb] is resident memory and is the number to reason about when
 * asking "was this process big enough for the LMK to kill it". The Java heap
 * comes from `Runtime`, which is reliable everywhere. The legacy native figure
 * is still emitted, but explicitly labelled so nobody treats it as truth again.
 *
 * All reads are cheap: two `Runtime` calls plus one small proc file, no
 * allocation beyond the parsed longs. Safe to sample per timeline step.
