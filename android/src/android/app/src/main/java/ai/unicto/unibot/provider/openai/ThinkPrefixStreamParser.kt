/**
 * [T-android-think-prefix-stream] Splits a streamed `content` field into live
 * thinking deltas and visible body text, for models that embed reasoning as a
 * `<think>…</think>` PREFIX of `content` instead of using the
 * `reasoning_content` field (MiniMax M3, some Qwen/DeepSeek deployments).
 *
 * Port of iOS `ThinkPrefixStreamParser` (22ca4285). Replaces the previous
 * `extractThinkTags` scanner, which had two defects reproduced on Android:
 *
 *  1. **Leading whitespace leaked into the body.** M3 always emits "\n\n" after
 *     `</think>`; the old scanner passed it straight through, so every such
 *     message body began with a blank line. A think-only tool turn could also
 *     leave a whitespace-only text block, which renders as a blank band because
 *     every empty-block guard checks `isEmpty()` and "\n\n" passes that.
 *  2. **Mid-text tags were stripped anywhere.** The old scanner searched for
 *     `<think>` at ANY offset, so a message merely *explaining* the tag —
 *     "Use the `<think>` tag to mark reasoning" — had its prose silently
 *     swallowed into the thinking bubble. Verified against the old
 *     implementation: `"Use the <think> tag to mark reasoning."` produced
 *     visible `"Use the "` and thinking `" tag to mark re"`.
 *
 * Design: an explicit `UNDECIDED → THINKING → BODY` state machine.
 *  - Only a `<think>` at the very START of a turn (leading whitespace tolerated
 *    and dropped) enters THINKING. Anything else commits the turn to BODY, and
 *    from then on tags are passed through verbatim.
 *  - After `</think>`, leading whitespace is dropped, and a trailing-whitespace
 *    run is withheld until proven interior — so a think-only turn ends with an
 *    empty body rather than "\n\n".
 *
 * Not thread-safe; one instance per streaming turn (the provider creates one
 * per request).
