/**
 * [T-android-thinking-rules-phase2 / parity with iOS 4d7fb9b4] One user-authored
 * thinking rule, scoped to a single provider instance.
 *
 * Only CUSTOM rules are persisted — built-in vendor rules are compile-time constants
 * in [ai.unicto.unibot.provider.thinking.ThinkingRuleResolver.builtInRules] and are
 * never stored (mirrors the iOS constraint). The resolver reads a provider's persisted
 * rows in [sortOrder] order and prepends them ABOVE the built-in list, so a custom rule
 * can override a vendor default by matching first, but can never remove a built-in.
 *
 * The polymorphic [ThinkingWireFormat] is serialized to [wireFormatJson] rather than
 * spread across typed columns: the format is a sealed hierarchy with per-case params
 * (offValue, path, budget floor, per-tier value maps), and a JSON blob keeps one
 * migration stable as new formats are added — the same tactic used by
 * [ProviderModelGroupEntity.memberEntryIdsJson].
 *
 * Lives in `provider.db` next to the instances the rules belong to (see
 * [ProviderDatabase]). Android provider config is local-only (no cloud sync), so a hard
 * delete of a row is final and cannot be resurrected — no tombstone is needed here (a
 * tombstone only earns its keep against a sync channel that could re-push a deleted row,
 * which Android does not have for provider config).
