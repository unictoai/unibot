 * How a given endpoint expects the thinking/reasoning control to appear on the wire.
 *
 * Every entry is anchored to a shipped field report or vendor doc — see
 * `/tmp/thinking_rules_evidence.md` §A for the provenance chain (17 rules mined from git
 * history, each with a file:line and commit hash). The short form is kept here so the
 * reasoning survives next to the code.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS `ThinkingWireFormat.swift` case for case; the two must stay in step, since
 * the whole point of the rule registry is that a vendor contract is described ONCE.
 *
 * PHASE 1 SCOPE: models the OpenAI-compatible family only (everything flowing through
 * [ai.unicto.unibot.provider.openai.OpenAIProvider]). Gemini and Anthropic have their
 * own emitters and are deliberately NOT routed here yet — their formats are declared so
 * the vocabulary is complete, but nothing resolves to them on this path. Phase 2 wires
 * them up.
