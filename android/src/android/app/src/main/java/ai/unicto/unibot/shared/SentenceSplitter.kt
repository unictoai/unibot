/**
 * [T-android-voice-correction] Lightweight punctuation-based sentence
 * splitting. Pure rules, no third-party dependency. Port of iOS
 * `Shared/SentenceSplitter.swift`.
 *
 * The terminator set is defined ONCE here and reused by everything that reasons
 * about sentence boundaries — the edit-diff pass that aligns a before/after
 * edit, and the correction context builder's excerpt selection. Keeping a
 * single definition is deliberate: a second, slightly different set elsewhere
 * would silently misalign sentences between the two.
 *
 * NOTE this is a different set from [ai.unicto.unibot.speech.ReadAloudPlayer]'s
 * TTS chunking terminators, which deliberately includes `\n` (a line break is a
 * natural place to breathe) and excludes `；`/`…`. These two are not
 * interchangeable; do not merge them.
