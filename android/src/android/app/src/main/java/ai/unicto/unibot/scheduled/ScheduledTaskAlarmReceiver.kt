/**
 * [T-android-scheduled-tasks-design] Receives an AlarmManager fire and
 * hands the task off to [ScheduledAgentRunner].
 *
 * This is a HANDOFF, not a run: everything here must finish in
 * milliseconds. goAsync() covers only "load the task, arm the next
 * occurrence, start the FGS and dispatch the prompt"; the agent loop
 * itself then runs on [ScheduledAgentRunner]'s app-scoped scope, kept
 * alive by the foreground service (and its wake lock) rather than by this
 * broadcast.
 *
 * [GH#197] It used to await the entire agent loop before calling
 * pending.finish(), which held the broadcast for minutes and ANR-killed
 * the process — and with it every PRoot sandbox child. goAsync() alone
 * does not buy unlimited time; it only defers the deadline, so the work
 * it wraps still has to be short.
