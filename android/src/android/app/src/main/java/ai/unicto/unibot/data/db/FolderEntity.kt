/**
 * [T-android-session-grouping] A session group. Code says "Folder", the UI says
 * "Group" — the same deliberate split iOS uses, because `ModelGroup` (LLM
 * fallback routing) already owns the word "Group" at symbol level.
 *
 * Mirrors the iOS `folders` table (ChatStore.swift:795) column-for-column so a
 * future sync layer can map the two without a translation step.
 *
 * ## Why `name` is NOT unique
 *
 * Two devices can each create "Work" offline; both are kept, as two rows with
 * different UUIDs. Keying on the name instead would turn a rename from a
 * one-field edit into an identity change — delete the old key, create a new
 * one, migrate every member — which tears across devices: A renames while B
 * files under the old name, and B's sessions end up pointing at a key that no
 * longer exists. A locally-generated UUID needs no cross-device coordination,
 * which is exactly the property offline creation requires.
 *
 * Consequence: every name-based lookup must tolerate multiple matches.
