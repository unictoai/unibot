     * History, because this number has been wrong twice:
     *  - The design originally specified 800ms. On a real device with a real
     *    provider that timed out EVERY time (~830-860ms, request still in
     *    flight), so the trigger moved to "transcript has landed and the user
     *    is reading it" — nothing is blocked while this runs — and iOS raised
     *    the ceiling to 5s.
     *  - 5s was still too tight on Android. Measured against MiMo on a Pixel
     *    4a, a SHORT prompt round-trips in ~4.1s; a correction prompt carries
     *    evidence blocks plus conversation context and reliably exceeded 5s
     *    (observed 9.5s), so every correction returned llm_timeout.
     *
     * 15s is sized to catch a genuinely hung request while leaving room for a
     * slow provider on a slow device. Nothing waits on it — the user is
     * reading their transcript — so a generous ceiling costs nothing, whereas
     * a tight one silently disables the feature.
