 * Adapter for a single speech-to-text backend.
 *
 * Implementations exist for:
 *  - [SystemSpeechRecognitionEngine]: wraps android.speech.SpeechRecognizer,
 *    smooths over OEM fragmentation (Pixel/Samsung/Xiaomi … AOSP / HarmonyOS).
 *  - [ProviderSpeechRecognitionEngine]: captures PCM via AudioRecord and
 *    dispatches it to the resolved cloud provider's transcription endpoint
 *    through the VoiceProvider stack. One-shot on stop — it reports
 *    `supportsPartialResults = false`, so the System engine remains the
 *    streaming/live-transcript option.
 *
 * Engines are stateless w.r.t. other engines: the [SpeechRecognitionManager]
 * owns selection and state aggregation.
