/**
 * Bridges the user-facing [MountedFoldersStore] to the parts of the app
 * that enforce read-only-mount semantics and feed bind specs into PRoot.
 * Mirrors iOS `MountedFolderCoordinator` but only the methods we actually
 * need on Android — there is no NSFileCoordinator equivalent here because
 * once Option A resolves a SAF tree URI to a real POSIX path, the kernel
 * (not the app) handles cross-process consistency.
 *
 * Consumers (per T219 spec):
 *  - T219-3 PRootKernel: [bindMountSpecs] to seed `proot -b` flags.
 *  - T219-3 FileWriteTool / FileEditTool: [requireWritable] /
 *    [isLinuxPathUnderReadOnlyMount] to short-circuit writes against
 *    locked mounts before touching disk.
