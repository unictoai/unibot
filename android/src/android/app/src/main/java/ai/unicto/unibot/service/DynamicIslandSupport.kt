/**
 * [T-android-dynamic-island] Capability probe for Android 16 (Baklava, API 36)
 * "Live Updates" — the promoted-ongoing-notification surface users perceive as
 * the "dynamic island" / always-visible status chip.
 *
 * A device "supports the dynamic island" only when BOTH hold:
 *   1. It runs Android 16+ (`Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 36`), so the
 *      `Notification.ProgressStyle` + `FLAG_PROMOTED_ONGOING` +
 *      `NotificationManager.canPostPromotedNotifications()` APIs exist, AND
 *   2. `NotificationManager.canPostPromotedNotifications()` returns true — this
 *      reflects the *system + per-app user grant* (the user can disable Live
 *      Updates for this app from system settings), so it can flip at runtime.
 *
 * The probe is intentionally NOT cached: callers re-query it each time the app
 * becomes foreground-visible (spec §3) so a permission the user toggled off in
 * system settings is picked up without needing a process restart. It's a cheap
 * synchronous call.
 *
 * As of 2026-07 this only actually returns true on Pixel 6+ hardware running
 * the Android 16 QPR that shipped Live Updates; on every other device the guard
 * short-circuits at the SDK_INT check (pre-16) or `canPostPromotedNotifications`
 * (16 without the feature), so all the mutual-exclusion logic degrades cleanly
 * to the existing overlay + plain-notification behavior.
