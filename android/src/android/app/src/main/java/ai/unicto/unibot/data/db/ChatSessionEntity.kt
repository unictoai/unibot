     * corruption: a future sync could deliver the session before its group, and

     * SessionListViewModel's grouping pass) instead of failing a constraint or
     * making the session vanish. Same rule as iOS (ChatStore.swift:610).

     * NOTE for anyone adding list diffing: this field MUST participate in
     * equality. Moving a session between groups changes nothing else — not even
     * `updatedAt`, by design — so a differ that ignores it keeps drawing the row
     * in its old section.
