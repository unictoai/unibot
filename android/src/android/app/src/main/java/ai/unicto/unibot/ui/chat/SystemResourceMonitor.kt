/**
 * Lightweight CPU/memory sampler used for shell-tool live HUDs.
 *
 * - **CPU**: This app process's own CPU usage, reported in top-style IRIX
 *   percentage where 100% means one fully-loaded core. On an 8-core
 *   device a hf-render burst that occupies 1.1 cores reads ~110%; full
 *   saturation reads up to 800%. Picked over the iOS-style normalized
 *   0-100% because it matches what `adb shell top` shows for the same
 *   process — a dev cross-checking the HUD against top sees identical
 *   numbers, and the value visually tracks the actual load (a busy
 *   render no longer reads as a deceptively-quiet 12%).
 *
 *   Computed from `/proc/self/stat`: `(Δutime + Δstime) / (Δwall * CLK_TCK)
 *   * 100`. Field 14 (utime) and 15 (stime) are 1-indexed in man proc, but
 *   field 2 is the parenthesized comm name which can contain spaces or
 *   close-parens — so we locate the *last* `)` and parse from there to
 *   avoid mis-splitting. Sampled every 2 s and sum-averaged over the last
 *   5 samples (≈10-s rolling window) — gives a stable reading that doesn't
 *   drop to 0 on a single GC pause or IO block. The first sample after
 *   construction returns 0% — there's no prior baseline to diff against.
 *
 *   T303 history: T244 (commit 8750340) had switched to `/proc/stat` to
 *   capture the system-wide load thinking shell_execute child processes
 *   wouldn't be attributed to the app — but in practice `/proc/stat` is
 *   permission-denied to apps on Android 8+, so the read silently failed
 *   and the HUD read "CPU 0%" under any load. PRoot on Android works via
 *   ptrace, so foreign syscalls run inside the app's own PID anyway and
 *   `/proc/self/stat` does cover hf-render etc. (verified: `top` reports
 *   the same ~110% on ai.unicto.unibot while hf-render runs).
 * - **Memory**: `Debug.getMemoryInfo().totalPss * 1024` for "used" (matches
 *   what task_info(TASK_VM_INFO) reports on iOS — proportional set size,
 *   the closest cross-platform equivalent to "what this process owns now");
 *   `ActivityManager.MemoryInfo.totalMem` for the device cap.
 *
 * The class itself is stateful (last-tick baselines) but doesn't push state
 * into Compose — pair it with [rememberSystemResourceMonitor] to drive a
 * recompose loop while the caller wants live numbers.
