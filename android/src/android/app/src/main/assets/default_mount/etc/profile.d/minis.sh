# Loaded by /etc/profile via the profile.d mechanism (login shells only).

# T294: prompt parity with iOS — `root@minis:/var/minis#`. iOS bakes the
# literal "minis" into PS1 (deps/prepare_alpine_rootfs.sh) rather than
# relying on \h, so the prompt is stable regardless of what /etc/hostname
# happens to contain. We do the same on Android so a fresh install
# matches without needing a rootfs rebuild.

# envp via PRootKernel.customEnvironment so non-login shells (which never
# source profile.d) still see it. The xdg-open / sensible-browser /

# real files in default_mount/usr/local/bin/ and are overlaid on every
# boot.

# T222: PRoot's link2symlink extension creates .l2s.* sentinel files alongside
# every hardlinked file. uv's default `hardlink` mode tries to re-link these
# sentinels when populating site-packages, which PRoot rejects with EPERM.
# Force uv to symlink package files instead — the sentinels are then never
# touched as link sources. Reported as openminis/openminis#7.
