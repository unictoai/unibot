/**
 * [T-android-latex-code-mask] Regression coverage for issue #117 defect 3
 * (ported from iOS bce7e2ed).
 *
 * Before the fix, `findDoubleDollar` / `findSingleDollar` were blind forward
 * scans. A single unclosed `$$` in prose paired with a `$$` inside a LATER
 * fenced code block and swallowed every paragraph in between — including the
 * fence's own opening line — which then left an orphaned closing ``` that
 * turned the rest of the message into a code block. Symptom: "a whole
 * section suddenly disappeared".
