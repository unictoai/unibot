/**
 * [T-android-auto-grouping-injection] Guards the sanitizer that group names and
 * descriptions pass through before they are folded into the title-generation
 * prompt.
 *
 * Group names are free-form user input with no length or content limit, and
 * they are rendered into an instruction as `"name" — desc; "name2" — desc2`.
 * Without stripping, a name can close the quote/bracket and have the remainder
 * read as instruction.
