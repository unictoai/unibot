/**
 * [T-android-correction-admission-multisignal] Locks the multi-signal admission
 * rule against the real correction_events that motivated the iOS redesign
 * (bf0234a7). Each case asserts whether the edit span should be COLLECTED (an
 * ASR/IME mistake worth learning) or REJECTED (a plain content rewrite), plus
 * targeted unit checks on each signal.
 *
 * The normalizer is injected: production PinyinNormalizer uses `android.icu`,
 * which is unavailable on the JVM. The fake maps the exact terms these cases
 * use to the same pinyin keys the real normalizer produces, and passes
 * Latin/digits through literally — which is what the real one does too, and is
 * precisely why the old single-axis rule mis-scored mixed-script edits.
