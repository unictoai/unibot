 * [T-android-correction-admission-multisignal] The admission rule that

 * (`phoneticSim >= 0.6 AND lengthRatio <= 2`) inline, which meant they kept
 * passing while testing logic that no longer shipped. They now drive the real
 * [CorrectionAdmission.judge]. The normalizer is injected because the
 * production PinyinNormalizer needs `android.icu`, unavailable on the JVM —
 * the wired-up path is covered by the instrumented suite.
