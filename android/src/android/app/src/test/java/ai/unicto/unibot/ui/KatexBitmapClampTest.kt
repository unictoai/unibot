/**
 * [GH#206] The clamp arithmetic used by both KaTeX snapshot sites.
 *
 * The production sites allocate a real Bitmap, which needs an Android runtime,
 * so this pins the SIZING DECISION — the part that actually caused the leak.
 * Before the fix there was no upper bound at all: `pxW = cssPx * density` went
 * straight into `Bitmap.createBitmap`, so a wide display formula on a
 * density-2.75 device could ask for a bitmap approaching the 8192 px layout
 * viewport, i.e. ~5 MB of NATIVE heap for ONE formula.
 *
 * Kept as a local copy of the formula rather than exposing the production
 * constants: the point is to state the intended contract independently, so a
 * change to the production numbers has to be a deliberate edit here too.
