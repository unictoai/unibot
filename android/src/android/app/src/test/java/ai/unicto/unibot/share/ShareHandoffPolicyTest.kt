 * [T-android-share-launch-crash] Proves the guard that keeps a failed
 * MainActivity hand-off from crashing the app (vivo V2352A / GH share crash).
 *
 * The device could not be used to prove this: forcing `startActivity` to fail
 * needs `pm disable-user`, which the shell is not permitted to do on this
 * device ("SecurityException: Shell cannot change component state"). Driving
 * the decision layer directly is stronger anyway — it reproduces the exact
 * exception shape from the crash log, which no device-side injection would.
