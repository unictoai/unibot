/**
 * [T-android-fallback-entry-identity] Identity of a fallback target.
 *
 * Field report: with a `Default Model` group of
 *   [GPT-5.6 Terra(OpenAI2), GPT-5.6 Luna(OpenAI2), deepseek-v4-flash(DeekSeak), …]
 * a dead OpenAI2 key made group-fallback walk to `deepseek-v4-flash`, served by
 * the "DeekSeak" instance (api.deepseek.com). The UI then displayed the provider
 * as **"Bailian OpenAI"** (dashscope.aliyuncs.com).
 *
 * Cause: after switching, the code recovered the entry with
 *
 *     modelEntries.find { it.model.id == currentProvider.model.id }
 *
 * On that device TWO entries share the model id `deepseek-v4-flash` — one under
 * DeekSeak, one under Bailian OpenAI — so `find` returned whichever came first
 * in `modelEntries`, not the one that actually served the request. That wrong
 * entry then fed `_activeEntryId`, `_providerName` AND the persisted
 * `lastEntryId` binding, so re-entering the session resumed on the wrong
 * instance too.
 *
 * These tests pin the DISAMBIGUATION RULE rather than the ViewModel (which needs
 * an Android runtime): an entry must be identified by its own id, never by the
 * model id it happens to expose.
