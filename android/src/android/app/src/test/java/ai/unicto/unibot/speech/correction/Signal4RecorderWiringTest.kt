/**
 * [T-android-correction-latin-phonetic] Integration-level guard: proves Signal 4
 * is reachable through the SAME judge() entry point VoiceCorrectionRecorder
 * calls (recorder line ~94), with the recorder's real argument shape — the
 * production PhoneticNormalizer passes Latin through lowercased, and
 * sentenceLength is the context sentence's length.
 *
 * The recorder itself needs a Context + SQLite, so it can't run on the JVM;
 * this pins the contract at the boundary it actually uses.
