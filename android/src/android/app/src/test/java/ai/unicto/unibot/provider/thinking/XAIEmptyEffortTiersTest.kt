/**
 * [OpenMinis#163] Android port of iOS 3ba3eb5c.
 *
 * Enabling thinking on xAI `grok-build-0.1` fails with "HTTP 400: Model
 * grok-build-0.1 does not support parameter reasoningEffort". models.dev
 * describes that state as `"reasoning": true` + `"reasoning_options": []` —
 * "reasons, but takes no effort parameter".
 *
 * The value of these tests is mostly in the CONTROLS: the same empty-tier shape
 * appears on 2090 bundled catalog entries, so the tests that must keep passing
 * are the ones proving the skip did NOT widen to them.
