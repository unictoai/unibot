// SessionFileChangeTracker.swift
//
// Receives file change events from the iSH fakefs bind-mount tracker
// (`fakefs_record_change` in deps/ish/fs/fake.c) via ISHKernel, dedupes
// them per (sessionId, relPath), and exposes drain APIs for SyncCore to
// translate them into SessionFile dirty rows just before push.
//
// Design:
//   - Producer: ISHKernel handler queue → `recordBatch(_:)`.
//   - Storage: in-memory dict, last-write-wins per relPath.
//   - Consumer: SyncCore.sendNow() calls `drainAll()` before scanning
//     sync_dirty_records, so any pending file changes turn into
//     SessionFile dirty rows for this push cycle.
//
// Concurrency: actor isolates producer/consumer. Producers `await` to
// record (cheap; producer lives on a serial queue and accepts arbitrary
// latency since the C-side ring buffer absorbs bursts). The consumer
// drains and clears atomically — events recorded between drain and
// markDirty stay in the next snapshot, never lost.
