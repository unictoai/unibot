/// GOLDEN SNAPSHOT of `OpenAIAgentProvider.injectThinkingParams`.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is different from ThinkingRulesRegressionTests:
/// the regression suite asserts the *rules we knew to look for* — it encodes intent,
/// one hand-written assertion per catalogued rule. This file asserts something weaker
/// but much broader: that for a matrix of (model × level × endpoint-flag) combinations,
/// the emitted body is **byte-for-byte what it is today**, whatever that happens to be.
///
/// That distinction matters for the Thinking Rules refactor. The acceptance criterion is
/// "behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged", but the regression suite only covers the
/// vendors it was written for (Mistral / Venice / DeepSeek / Qwen / MiMo / Ark / GLM) —
/// it says nothing about the OpenAI-native o/gpt-5 branch, the OpenRouter nested shape,
/// seed, xAI, or nous. Passing it proves "the parts we tested did not change", not
/// "nothing changed". These snapshots close that gap by pinning the ACTUAL current
/// output of every branch of the if-return chain, including branches nobody wrote a
/// named rule for.
///
/// HOW TO USE DURING THE REFACTOR
///   1. This file is committed BEFORE the refactor, generated against the OLD code.
///   2. After the refactor, it must still pass unchanged. A diff here is a behaviour
///      change — either an unintended regression, or an intended fix that must be
///      called out explicitly in the commit message and updated deliberately.
///   3. Do NOT regenerate expectations to make a red test green without first
///      explaining, in words, why the wire format legitimately changed.
///
/// The snapshot is a canonical JSON rendering (sorted keys, stable number formatting)
/// so a dictionary-ordering change can never masquerade as a behaviour change.
///
/// READING THE BASELINE — one row looks alarming and is not: `mimo/xhigh` and
/// `seed/xhigh` record `reasoning_effort:"xhigh"`, even though both families 400 on
/// exactly that value (72968c4f). That is correct: the family ceiling is applied
/// UPSTREAM of this function, at AgentProvider.swift:203
/// (`min(thinkingLevel, model.catalogMaxThinkingLevel)`), so in production
/// injectThinkingParams is never called with xhigh for those ids. These rows pin the
/// behaviour of this function in isolation; the ceiling itself is covered by
/// ThinkingRulesRegressionTests' catalog assertions. Do not "fix" the snapshot by
/// clamping here — that would move the ceiling into a second place and let the two
/// drift apart.
