/// Regression safety-net for the thinking/reasoning wire-format rules catalogued in

///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS: the dominant failure mode for these rules is SILENT DEGRADATION —
/// not a thrown error, but a field quietly landing at the wrong path or a tier quietly
/// collapsing onto the vendor default. Three shipped examples, none of which raised
/// an exception:
///   • 847822eb — the DeepSeek V4 tier was nested INSIDE `thinking:{}` instead of being
///     a root sibling, so every request ran at the vendor default for ~3 months.
///   • 22647505 — a glm/kimi/deepseek/minimax id-substring skip-list emitted NO thinking
///     field at all; the server silently applied its own default tier.
///   • 5aa9dc64 — the Claude Opus catalog rules used dots while real ids use hyphens, so
///     the rules NEVER matched and every Opus model fell through to the wrong ceiling.
/// Accordingly, every positive assertion here is paired with a mutually-exclusive
/// negative one, and assertions target the REAL emitted body, never a reimplementation.
///
/// These call production code directly: `OpenAIAgentProvider.injectThinkingParams` is
/// `static` + `internal`, so `@testable import` reaches it and returns the mutated body
/// dictionary with no network, no credentials, and no provider instance. Where a rule
/// lives on an instance method the corresponding static seam is used instead
