/// Resource sampling for the browser-use tool path.
///
/// Motivation: a `browser_use` action issued while the app is backgrounded was
/// observed hanging for ~287 minutes without returning. The suspicion is that
/// iOS suspends the out-of-process WebContent that WKWebView drives, so the
/// action's continuation never resumes — as opposed to an in-app deadlock. We
/// don't have enough signal to tell those apart, so this samples the resource
/// picture around every action.
///
/// Deliberately NOT reusing `SystemResourceMonitor` (AIChatView.swift): that is
/// a `@Published` UI ticker on a 2s main-run-loop `Timer` scoped to a visible
/// sheet, samples *system-wide* CPU via `host_statistics`, and stops when its
/// view disappears — precisely the moment we most need data (backgrounded, no
/// UI). `CrashReporter`'s samplers are `private` and snapshot-only. So this is a
/// separate, log-only, background-safe sampler; nothing here feeds SwiftUI.
///
/// ## What we can and cannot see (read this before adding a memory field)
///
/// **We cannot measure WKWebView's memory from inside the app.** Not "we haven't
/// found the API" — it is closed off by design, and assuming otherwise will make
/// you misread these logs:
///
/// - Rendering runs in a separate process (`com.apple.WebKit.WebContent`). Its
///   footprint is **not** counted in our `task_info`, and our app will not even
///   reliably get a memory warning when WebContent is under pressure.
/// - Reading another process's footprint needs `task_for_pid()` (barred by the
///   sandbox) or `proc_pid_rusage()` (won't cross to WebContent). And we can't
///   get its pid anyway: the public WebKit headers expose no process identifier.
///   `_webProcessIdentifier` is SPI — an App Store review risk, so not an option.
/// - Instruments/Activity Monitor *can* see it only because they are external
///   debuggers outside our sandbox. That capability does not exist at runtime.
///
/// So WebContent dies on its OWN jetsam budget (empirically ~300-450MB for a web
/// page, no fixed limit — it varies with device RAM and system load), and iOS
/// kills just that child process while our app survives untouched.
///
/// The practical consequence for the fields below: `appAvailableMemoryMB` is
/// **our** headroom and says nothing about WebContent. WebContent can climb to
/// its ceiling and get killed while that number does not move at all. It is kept
/// as an app-side baseline ONLY — never read it as "the browser had plenty of
/// memory". The one trustworthy signal that WebContent died is
/// `webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate`, with `probeWebContentLiveness` as a
/// fallback for when that callback doesn't fire (it often doesn't if the process
/// dies mid-render).
