//  TextFadeAnimator.swift
//  Minis
//
//  Word-by-word fade-in animation for streaming Markdown output.
//
//  When the renderer appends new tokens to a message's textStorage via the
//  `[AttachHotPath]` append-only fast path in SelectableMarkdownView, instead
//  of the new glyphs popping in instantly we fade each word from alpha 0 → 1
//  with a small per-word stagger, producing a "ripple" reveal.
//
//  Design constraints (see /tmp/task_word_fade_animation.md):
//   - Display-layer only. Does NOT touch MinisMarkdownParser / AST /
//     MarkdownNSRenderer. We mutate the live NSTextStorage's `.foregroundColor`
//     attribute and rely on TextKit 1's behaviour that a foregroundColor change
//     does NOT invalidate layout (no `ensureLayout` reflow) — only a redraw.
//   - O(new words), never O(full text). Only the appended NSRange is scanned.
//   - A single CADisplayLink drives ALL in-flight words; it stops itself once
//     every word has settled, so an idle (non-streaming) view costs nothing.
//
//  This file deliberately owns no parsing or rendering logic; it is a pure
//  per-word alpha scheduler over an existing NSTextStorage.
