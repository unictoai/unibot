// MARK: - AudioSessionCoordinator
//
// The SINGLE owner of AVAudioSession category/active across the app. Every
// subsystem that needs audio declares an INTENT via begin()/end(); the
// coordinator picks the highest-priority active intent and applies its session
// profile (the only place setCategory / setActive is called). This removes the
// previous "everyone calls setCategory last-wins" races and the foreground-return
// silence (a stale category survived because a partial guard skipped reconfigure).
//
// Audio sources → intents (System TTS and cloud TTS are the SAME `replyTTS`
// source, just different engines resolved from the Voice Output group):
//   .capture            — mic recording (.record/.measurement)            [highest]
//   .mediaAttachment    — Markdown audio attachment / auto_play playback
//   .replyTTS           — read-replies (cloud VoiceOutputPlayer OR System AVSpeech)
//   .backgroundKeepAlive— silent keep-alive track (background only)        [lowest]
//
// `.mediaAttachment` and `.replyTTS` are mutually exclusive at the source level
// (the media player preempts TTS — see AIChatViewModel.stopSpeech on play), so in
// practice only one of them is active; the coordinator still ranks them.
